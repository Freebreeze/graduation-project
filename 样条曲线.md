# Bezier Curve

## Definition
Given $n+1$ points $p_0,p_1,p_2...$in space,the control point,the Bezier curve defined by these control points is
$$
\mathbf{C}(u)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} B_{n, i}(u) \mathbf{P}_{i}\tag{1}
$$
where the coefficients are defined as follows:
$$
B_{n, i}(u)=\frac{n !}{i !(n-i) !} u^{i}(1-u)^{n-i}\tag{2}
$$


This definition may be a little inconprehensible. So we will anlysis the curve from the easiest form(two control points) to complix form(n control points).

## Two Control Points
Let $p_0$ to be the first control point and $p_1$ to be the second control point, then the curve will be writen as:
$$
B(t)=(1-t) p_{0}+t P_{1} \quad, t \in[0,1]\tag{3}
$$
We can see the produce of the curve by follow gif:

This is very easy to understand.

## Three Control Points

Bezier curve with three control points can be derived from that with two control points.
Firstly, let's look at following gif.

$p_0,p_1,p_2$ are three control points. There have a point above the line $p_0p_1$ and $p_1P_2$ respectively. We can set it as $A_{01}$ and $A_{12}$, then we can write the trajectory of $A_{01}$ and $A_{12}$ as follows:

$$
A_{01}(t)=(1-t) P_{0}+t P_{1} \tag{4}
$$
$$
A_{12}(t)=(1-t) P_{1}+t P_{2} \tag{5}
$$

Now we can set $A_{01}$ and $A_{12}$ to be control points. So the Bezier curve defined by three control points are:
$$
B(t)=(1-t) A_{01}+t A_{12} \tag{6}
$$
Bring the formula $(4)(5)$ to formula $(6)$, we can get:
$$
\mathbf{B}(t)=(1-t)^{2} \mathbf{P}_{0}+2 t(1-t) \mathbf{P}_{1}+t^{2} \mathbf{P}_{2}, t \in[0,1]\tag{7}
$$

## n Control Points
From the analysis about Bezier curve with three control points, we know that Bezier curve with $n$ control points has recursive relationship with Bezier curve with $(n-1)$ control points,which is written as follows:
$$
P_{i}^{k}=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}{P_{i}} & {k=0} \\ {(1-t) P_{i}^{k-1}+t P_{i+1}^{k-1}} & {k=1,2, \cdots, n, i=0,1, \cdots, n-k}\end{array}\right.\tag{8}
$$
